# Web-Optimization

## For this project I did this steps to provide an optimized Project

### To improve index.html performance: I did this steps:  
1-optimize and compress all the photos in index.html (I download the out src phots and did the same with them).
2-Minify and  compress all css and html and js included in the index.html page.
3-I made the print style only get download in print action by adding media=print.
4-I made the analytics.js defer so it will not block the rendering of the index.html.

### In main.js I did thiss steps:
In the callback function in DOMContentLoaded event inside scroll event I didt this steps:
1-calculate number of rows based on screen resolution (for pizza).
2-Get the number of required pizza to fill the screen.

### In changePizzaSizes function:
1-Make  the random Pizza Container out of the loop and I use getElementsByClassName to get because it's faster.
2-Get the size of the pizzaContainer to use it in the for loop rather than fixed number.
3-Since all the pizzas is the same size I create newwidth varible that contain the size of one of the pizzas and use it 4-to Set pizzaContainer.style.width.
